### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

We are the **Arctic Penguins** and we are passionate about open-source; especially
GNU/Linux. We also know how a GNU/Linux OS can be tricky and require careful
handling at times for beginners. With that in mind, we decided to dedicate
ourselves to help developers/users to thrive in their way through the Linux world.

#### Fun Fact âš¡

- There are no penguins at Arctic Circle; think about it.
